# ShapeImageMaker
The ShapeImageMaker is the problem of finding a set of colored shapes that represents an image.
Classically this problem has been proposed for solving the Monalisa painting, however any image can be represented 
as an overlap of shapes.

## In this folder:
We  can find the description of the classes in [SimplePolyImageMaker](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/SimplePolyImageMaker)
. The classes with changes are specify as follows:
1. [CustomGeneticAlgorithm](#customgeneticalgorithm): Implements GeneticAlgorithm.
2. [ShapeImageInitializer](#shapeimageinitializer): Extends GAInitializer.
3. [ShapeImageObjectiveFunction](#shapeimageobjectivefunction): Extends ObjectiveFunction.
4. [CustomChromosome](#customchromosome): Implements Chromosome.
5. [Mutations](#mutations): Folder with the mutations.
   1. [ChromosomeMutationChangeShapeType](#chromosomemutationchangeshapetype): Implements Mutation.
   2. [ChromosomeMutationColor](#chromosomemutationcolor):Implements Mutation.
   3. [ChromosomeMutationMoveShape](#chromosomemutationmoveshape): Implements Mutation.
   4. [ChromosomeMutationRotateShape](#chromosomemutationmoveshape): Implements Mutation.
   5. [GenomeMutationAddChromosome](#genomemutationaddchromosome): Implements Mutation.
6. [RunShapeImageOptimization](#runshapeimageoptimization): This is the main class. Here we instantiate our 
CustomGeneticAlgorithm Object with all his components.

### [CustomGeneticAlgorithm](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/CustomGeneticAlgorithm.java):
This class implements GeneticAlgorithm, which by extension makes it an Optimizer instance. In other words this class 
can be optimized and its results can be gathered.
````code
public void optimize(){...}
public Object getResult(){...}
````
The <i>optimize</i> function is implemented in a way that the generation number is passed as VarArg to most of the actions
executed by the CustomGeneticAlgorithm parts (CrossoverPolicy, MutationPolicy...). The <i>getResults</i> function 
returns an Image that will be stored or used to build the gif.

### [ShapeImageInitializer](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/ShapeImageInitializer.java):
Initializes a new individual from zero. In our case, uses CustomGenome, CustomChromosome, Color, Double and Shape to 
store the information of a randomly initialized individual.
````code
public Individual initializeIndividual()
````
In this case, the information is sparse in the GeneticInformationContainers.Genome and Chromosome contains information 
needed to evaluate an individual.

### [ShapeImageObjectiveFunction](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/ShapeImageObjectiveFunction.java):
This function evaluates the objective function of a solution. In this case we compute the l~2~ norm for the RGBA colors 
from the image generated by the genome against the colors in the real image.

This function return a Double containing the ratio of Euclidean color deviation per pixel of the whole image compared 
with the reference one.

### [CustomChromosome](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/CustomChromosome.java):
A Chromosome that contains the genetic information:
  * color (Color): Contains the Shape filling color.
  * rotation (Double): Contains the angle in radians that the affine transform has to apply to this shape.
  * shape (Shape): Shape that we want to fray in the image.

### [Mutations](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/Mutations):
Folder that contains all the mutations that are applied to the genomes.
1. #### [ChromosomeMutationChangeShapeType](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/Mutations/ChromosomeMutationChangeShapeType.java)
   Class that mutates a Chromosome. It changes the Shape type, but randomly initializing the new one in side the 
    bounding box of the old one.
2. #### [ChromosomeMutationColor](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/Mutations/ChromosomeMutationColor.java):
   Class that mutates a Chromosome. It slightly changes the color of that fills the shape randomly.
3. #### [ChromosomeMutationMoveShape](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/Mutations/ChromosomeMutationMoveShape.java):
   Class that mutates a Chromosome. It slightly moves one the shape.
   <ul>
       <li><b>Polygon:</b> Move one vertex.</li>
       <li><b>Ellipse2D:</b> Move the position of the whole shape or change  with and height.</li>
       <li><b>Arc2D:</b> Move the position of the whole shape, or, change  with and height, or, change angle start
       and extent, or, change arch type.</li>
       <li><b>CubicCurve2D:</b> Move X1 and Y1, or, X1ctrl and Y1ctrl, or, X2ctrl and Y2ctrl, or, X2 and Y2.</li>

4. #### [ChromosomeMutationRotateShape](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/Mutations/ChromosomeMutationRotateShape.java):
   Class that mutates the Chromosome. It slightly rotates the shape.
5. #### [GenomeMutationAddChromosome](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/Mutations/GenomeMutationAddChromosome.java):
   Class that mutates the Genome. Randomly creates and adds a Chromosome tho the genome (add one new shape).


### [RunShapeImageOptimization](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/ShapeImageMaker/RunShapeImageOptimization.java):
This is the main class. Is where the run starts. As simple as instantiate the CustomGeneticAlgorithm object (previously defined) filled
with its components, optimize it, and retrieve the results.

The specific components for the CustomGeneticAlgorithm are:
- MaxIterationCriteriaPolicy: A StoppingCriteria based on a maximum number of iteration.
- FixedCrossoverPolicy: A CrossoverPolicy that applies each iteration a fixed number of crossovers.
  - TournamentSelection: A Selection procedure in which each parent is chosen by the tournament method.

## Result example:

## Comment:
This is a more general approach that the used in the [SimplePolyImageMaker](https:/github.com/SergioOyaga/GeneticAlgorithmExamples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/soyaga/examples/ImageMaker/SimplePolyImageMaker).
However, general approaches are not always the best approaches. Clearly, while trying to recreate images with small 
curvatures, ellipses, quadratic or cubic curves might be more accurate than use simple polygons. This implementation is 
an example on how flexible can be an implementation using the OptimizationLib. We can commit the functions and classes 
to some abstract classes or interfaces (Shape) and "chain the responsibility" to higher or lower classes to implement
the behaviour of concrete classes (Polygon, Ellipse2D.Double, ...). We encourage to the reader to create his/her own
Shape implementation (ej.: ScreamingCatShape) and allow the optimization of an image using it :scream_cat:
